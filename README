This repository is my collection of lua scripts which work with rdis

/********************************************************
* INSTALLATION                                          *
********************************************************/

// REQUIREMENTS (in addition to rdis)
/////////////////////////////////////

    * luasocket
    * lgi ----- https://github.com/pavouk/lgi
    pacman -S lua51-socket

For lgi, I recommend you grab sources and build for your machine. While LGI is
in the Arch Linux package repos, lgi in the repos is for lua5.2. You will need
to build for lua 5.1.


// SET UP
/////////////////////////////////////
Create a file ~/.rdis.lua and add the following lines which will allow rdis to
automatically include rdis-lua on startup:

  -- change PATH_TO_RDIS_LUA to reflect your system
  local PATH_TO_RDIS_LUA = '/my/path/to/rdis'
  package.path = package.path .. ';' .. PATH_TO_RDIS_LUA .. '/?.lua'
  dofile(PATH_TO_RDIS_LUA .. '/rdis.lua')

/********************************************************
* GDB REMOTE DEBUGGING                                  *
********************************************************/

// NOTES
    This code is not suitable for trivial debugging. It is currently intended
    for development purposes only.

// SUPPORT PLATFORMS
    The only "implemented" architecture is amd64. It has only been tested in
    64-bit Arch Linux.

// USAGE
    gdb_gui(host, port, arch)
    gdb_remote(host, port, arch)
        host -> hostname where gdbserver is running
        port -> port gdbserver is running on
        arch -> the string 'amd64' is currently the only supported value
        returns: a gdb object.

        This function will connect to gdbserver, fetch the executable gdbserver
        is debugging (from /proc/pid), and then load it in rdis. It also spawns
        a gui for you to work with
